# COVID-19-operational-forecast
simple MCMC parameter estimation for forecasting COVID deaths (etc)

Should run out of the box to generate the forecast I published on morning of 11 April based on data to 10 April

UK.worldometer.txt needs to go in a data subdirectory (or just change the path in the code of course). It's basically cut and paste from the html on the worldometer page to create a trivial csv file. Other data sources are available.
